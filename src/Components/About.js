                <p className="about-p">I am a recent graduate from The Learning People and received my certificate of completion for Front end Plus in July 24.
                    <br />Previously being a hairdresser and sales assistant, I knew this wasn't the career for me. In 2023 I set myself a challenge,
                    <br />to find a new career, something different, something new, something that would challenge me. This is how i came to learn about coding,
                    <br />I first completed a 5 day coding challenge which was so fun and interesting to learn and that is when I knew coding was 100% for me!
                    <br />Since then, I have learned so much about front end development and I have loved every step of the way from HTML, CSS, Javascript, JSX, React,
                    <br />building projects, making mistakes, correcting mistakes and figuring solutions out for myself. I now feel I am ready and excited for the next step in my
                    <br />career, to land my first front end development job and gain some real-world experience and accomplish new challenges.
